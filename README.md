This is a small React app to visually display some of my previous projects. It is currently in progress. 

## Minor Fixes
* Add more detail to project descriptions
* Add more projects!

## Expansion 
* Add search bar functionality, or filtering of projects based on tags (Ruby, JavaScript, Node, etc.)
* Swap screenshots for gifs/video of the project being used

## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
